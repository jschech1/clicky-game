# Coding Clicky Memory Game

## The goal of the game is to try to click on as many coding languages as you can without repeating one before clicking on all of them. If you click on the same one twice, the app will replace the highscore if applicable and then reset.

## I chose to use coding language logos as a fun way for employers to see my work and resume at the same time.

## I created this memory game using React. I had to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
